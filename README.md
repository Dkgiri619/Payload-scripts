# Payloads 
These repo contains the scripts that I wrote for my recent exploits of well-known
vulnerabilities that I am practising in **ruby** or **python**. 

**You might find these useful**

## Content
It contains some malicious JWT generating scripts, bruteforcing, and some others.
I will try to update it every week. Cause these tools are very handy.

**If you feel you have some interesting scripts in your pocket please PR**
